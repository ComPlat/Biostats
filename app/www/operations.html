  <p><strong>Button Actions:</strong></p>
  <p>
    Each button represents a mathematical or logical operation.
    Click on a button to add the corresponding symbol or function to the text area titled <em>Operation</em>.
    This can include arithmetic operations like +, -, *, /;
    math functions like <code>log</code>, <code>sqrt</code>,
    or <code>exp</code>; and other operators such as comparisons
    (<code>></code>, <code>==</code>, etc.) and random number functions
    (<code>dnorm</code>, <code>runif</code>, etc.).
  </p>

  <p><strong>Direct Input:</strong></p>
  <p>
    You’re free to type directly into the <em>Operation</em> text area if that’s easier or if you want to write custom expressions.
    This flexibility lets you build complex operations or modify existing ones without relying solely on the buttons.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Intermediate Variables:</strong></p>
  <p>
    After entering an operation, you can run it and store it 
    as an intermediate result by clicking the <em>Run operation and store intermediate results</em> button.
    In the <em>Intermediate variable name</em> field, enter a name for the intermediate result.
    This stores the result for further use within your operations without immediately appending it to your dataset.
    Intermediate variables are useful for breaking down complex calculations into simpler parts.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Appending to Dataset:</strong></p>
  <p>
    To add the operation result as a new column in your dataset,
    use the <em>Run operation and append to dataset</em> button.
    Specify the column name in the <em>New column name</em> field,
    and the output will be appended to your dataset under this name.
    This is helpful for creating and saving computed columns directly
    into the data for easy access and analysis.
