## CO2 dataset

The CO2 dataset is available in R via the *datasets* package. Furthermore, the original data
is from Potvin1990. This study aims to convey statistical knowledge by analysing a dataset
form Potvin1986. The aim was to investigate the cold tolerance of C~4~ plants *Echinocloa crus-galli*.
Northern and southern plants of that species were subjected to day time chilling.
Moreover, the CO~2~ uptake was measured in dependence of the CO~2~ concentriation.

### Details 

- CO~2~ concentrations [mL/L]

```{r}
#| echo: false
df <- CO2
res <- unique(df$conc) |> t()
summary(df)
knitr::kable(res)
```

- Uptake in [µmol / m^2^ sec]
