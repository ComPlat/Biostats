## Likelihood of a Dataset
Likelihood refers to how probable a specific set of data is under a given model.
It quantifies the models ability to explain the observed data.
Maximizing the likelihood helps estimate the parameters that make the observed data
most probable (used in maximum likelihood estimation).

### fitdistr and AIC
- fitdistr (in MASS package): Fits a distribution to data by estimating
  its parameters using maximum likelihood estimation.
  It's useful for modeling and checking which distribution best matches your data.
- AIC (Akaike Information Criterion): Measures the relative quality
  of statistical models, balancing model fit and complexity. A lower AIC
  indicates a model that better explains the data with fewer parameters.

```{r Likelihood}
library(FAwR)
library(ggplot2)
library(MASS)
data(gutten)
hist(gutten$dbh.cm)
fit_norm <- fitdistr(gutten$dbh.cm, "normal")
fit_norm
likelihood <- prod(
  dnorm(gutten$dbh.cm,
  mean = fit_norm$estimate[1],
  sd = fit_norm$estimate[2])
) # Cannot be calculated like this by a computer --> is 0
likelihood <- sum(
  log(
    dnorm(gutten$dbh.cm,
      mean = fit_norm$estimate[1],
      sd = fit_norm$estimate[2])
  )
)
likelihood
logLik(fit_norm)
AIC(fit_norm)
BIC(fit_norm)

# log normal
fit_lognorm <- fitdistr(gutten$dbh.cm, "lognormal")
fit_lognorm
likelihood <- sum(
  log(
    dnorm(gutten$dbh.cm,
      mean = fit_lognorm$estimate[1],
      sd = fit_lognorm$estimate[2])
  )
)
likelihood
logLik(fit_lognorm)
AIC(fit_lognorm)
BIC(fit_lognorm)
```
