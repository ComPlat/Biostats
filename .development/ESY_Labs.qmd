## Overview

- 1. Describe DOE in Excel
  * Number of parameters
  * Boundaries of parameters
- 2. Rscript
  * generates DOE matrix
- 3. TPA sends DOE matrix back to ELN 
- 4. User collects DOE matrix via chemotion python API using the Device computer
- 5. Device measures samples and sends results back to ELN via Inbox (via Shuttle)

## Alternative

- 1. Describe DOE in Excel
  * Number of parameters
  * Boundaries of parameters
- 2. Rscript
  * generates DOE matrix
  * uses python API to generate one reaction variation per row in the DOE matrix
- 3. User collects Reaction variation via python API
- 4. Device measures samples and sends results back to ELN via Inbox (via Shuttle)
- 5. Maybe, python API can link the results with the respective Reaction variation
